\begin{abstract}
JavaScript performance is often bound by its dynamically-typed nature. Compiler writers do not have access to static type information, making generation of efficient, type-specialized machine code difficult. To avoid incurring extra overhead on the programmer and to improve the performance of already-deployed JavaScript programs at large, we seek to solve this problem by inferring types. Existing type inference algorithms for JavaScript, however, are often too computationally intensive and too imprecise---especially in the case of JavaScript's extensible objects---to enable optimizations. Both problems arise from performing purely static analyses. In this paper we present a hybrid type inference algorithm for JavaScript based on points-to analysis. Our algorithm is \emph{fast}, owing to its simplicity and laziness. Our algorithm is also \emph{precise}, by augmenting static analysis with run-time type barriers. We also showcase an implementation for Mozilla Firefox's JavaScript engine, demonstrating both performance gains and viability.
