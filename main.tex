\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
JavaScript performance is often bound by its dynamically-typed
nature. Compiler writers do not have access to static type information, making
generation of efficient, type-specialized machine code difficult. To avoid
incurring extra overhead on the programmer and to improve the performance of
already-deployed JavaScript programs at large, we seek to solve this problem
by inferring types. Existing type inference algorithms for JavaScript,
however, are often too computationally intensive and too
imprecise---especially in the case of JavaScript's extensible objects---to
enable optimizations. Both problems arise from performing purely static
analyses. In this paper we present a hybrid type inference algorithm for
JavaScript based on points-to analysis. Our algorithm is \emph{fast}, in that
it pays for itself in the optimizations it enables.  Our algorithm is also
\emph{precise}, by augmenting static analysis with run-time type barriers.

We also showcase an implementation for Mozilla Firefox's JavaScript engine,
demonstrating both performance gains and viability.
Through integration with the just-in-time (JIT) compiler in Firefox, we have improved
its performance on major benchmarks and JavaScript-heavy websites by up to 30\%.
This is tentatively scheduled to become the
default compilation mode in Firefox 9.
